This is a suspense novel about an assassin, there’s no horror in it. (The only thing close to it are a couple of mentions of the Overlook hotel in Colorado.) There is a scene, p 322-324, where Billy avenges a woman who was roofied and raped by three men. He decides to teach the main antagonist what it’s like to be raped, but it isn’t graphic and the rape-via-hand mixer isn’t described. It was about 200 pages too long, but it was a pretty good read.

well written…, but the use of obscenities wasn't well done in my estimation…There is also a LOT of gore. Children getting eaten by monsters, dead men hanging from trees with their rotting entrails spilling out, stuff like that. Due to the stream of consciousness style it was felt detached rather than horrific, however. …a brief…moment that I … a touch racially offensive… an albino was described as the colour of demons and a white scientist (This was the first time other than the albino that skin color was used as a overarching descriptor as he was a white man and was also practicing "white science") and basically he drank all his lab chemicals and turned into a mutant spider monster … that shot webs out of his penis. … All things considered though, I think this is actually going to be a good fit for the library, I just think I'm pretty far from the target audience here... which is sad, ‘cause the book sounded amazing!
This is the modernized tale of the origins of Black Lighning. Quite good, I would recommend.

This is a judgement call. Read ch. 17, ch. 27, ch. 39, and ch. 57. One of the characters is a man transforming into some sort of man-like monster, and his personality is transforming into something very vicious. At one point he attacks a woman with the intent of raping her but then eats her instead. The act of cannibalism isn't graphically described. He also threatens to harm a child to get to the child's mother, but the mother thwarts the plan. Genre: horror with strong sci-fi elements

Okay, so this is on me. I read in the description that it was spiral bound, but we have volume 1 and it ISN’T spiral bound, so I figured it was a mistake. Also, I’ve bought spiral-bound before and rebound them with twine and it’s worked out very well. Unfortunately, I missed the “tracing paper” part of the description. Each drawing section starts with a piece of tracing paper bound into the book and instructions on tracing the drawing. There’s also a “grid method” for each section, including a grid to draw the picture in. I’m going to try to return it, but if it’s too late, we’re going to have to do a lot of work to be able to keep it. Save your money. And time.

Marks - Couple of scenes were close to the line. But overall this is a badly thoughout book. Wouldn't recommend any one else buying this Young - "This is a terribly written book. The writing is horrid and the main character needs shaken and slapped. And the subject matter is vile. I’m not at all upset about returning this one."
An informative "how-to" draw comic book-style characters. Very PG.
Longenecker - recommended; "sad read" Richtman - a little racially charged (response to the Zimmerman trial), but I think the message overpowers the race relations

Hooo boy. This was one of those weird sci-fi books that the author has worked So. Darn. Hard. to let you know you're in space wif' awiens. So there's a LOT of genesplicing, gender modification, discussion of fetishes etc. but nothing extra problematic. Until the step by step tantric explanation on how to prevent ejaculation on pp. 89 - 91. Which by itself, still wasn't ban worthy because at the end of the day I thought that the technique would actually cut down on fluid exchange - however, when combined with the step by step explanation on pp 206 - 207 on how to give an amazing blowjob to a hermaphrodite (and I'm assuming males) I thought that this was just a bit too instructive.
