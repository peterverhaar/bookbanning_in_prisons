This is about Ronan Farrow trying to report on Harvey Weinstein and being shut down by NBC. Some of the descriptions of what Weinstein did, however, along with a description of what Wood Allen did to his sister, make me think that this is “detrimental to the offenders’ rehabilitation”.

Gasper - This book includes some of the author's back story about being a drug dealer. It also talks about his experiences in prison, including some of what the guards did to him. However, the good outweighs the bad and I think the offenders will get a lot out of it. There are a few recipes, his meal plan while incarcerated, how he became successful when he got out, and all of the workouts he did in prison. Spencer - The workouts look great, but the author also recounts his life story throughout the book. He talks about his past drug dealing, methods he used to increase business (especially in prison), and how the guards would beat him up, etc...young--This is an exercise book, but the author talks about how when he was in prison he would get weed from the guards and how the guards would beat on offenders for any reason whatsoever.

Autobiography of one of the 80's/90's biggest drug dealers. He has "reformed," but this reads more like a glorification of his drug dealing days. It also portrays law enforcement in a negative manner. It was not slated for review, but after reading it, I'm going to pass.

Paged through entire book. It's about a boy in a juvenile detention center and his progression towards fixing his life. A few fight scenes and some drug talk, but nothing worth pulling. Will keep this one.
the book has a general air of “sexiness”, which is fine content-wise, but does not bode well for keeping the book intact, and 2) there is a scene where the main character is persuaded to have sex even though she doesn’t really want to. It’s not graphic, but I think it does fall under ” depicts or describes information detrimental to the offender’s rehabilitation”.

Read through each story. There is mention of crimes and drug use, but nothing instructive or too graphic. These stories are like someone talking at an AA meeting and then they talk about the steps they've taken to improve their lives. The book offers methods for improvement as well.
There were two issues with the book: first, there is a firefight in which the insurgents are using a mosque for cover and the US and Iraqi forces have to attack it. They do so with a great amount of enthusiasm which could be offensive to a Muslim reader. The other issue was on page 344 (ten pages from the end of the book) where the author is getting ready to go home. They have snuck alcohol into the camp and are in the process of getting drunk. However, the issue is the next few lines: "The guy who sold us the stuff said he could get us some hash as well, but we figured there was going to be a drug test any day now, so we passed on the hash. None of us had any niacin to flush the drugs out of our system anyway. (Niacin is this trick stoners in the Army use to pass drug tests. After you smoke pot, you take some niacin for a couple days, and supposedly it flushes it all out of your system.)" I blacked out this text with permission from Deputy Warden Woffard.

The reviews on this were excellent. Goldberg was Cobain’s music manager, so the book is very oriented around the business parts of being a rock star. Some talk of drug use, but in a critical way—not glorifying it.

A pretty good book. He mentions his drug use, all of his stints in county jail, and his time in a federal prison, but he also talks about how these were the lowest times in his life and that he needs to stay out of jail and sober in order to be with his son and family. It sends a good message..../ There's a redemptive element to it, but his turn-around comes after 200-odd pages of descriptions of drug dealing and abuse. There's also a description on how to make an intoxicating substance. My admin said no.

The essay titled Brown vs. Ferguson contains extensive racially inflammatory language in its review of the history of the “black lives matter” episode. Additionally, this book contains a graphic strip which portrays the sad situation of a homeless alcoholic who ends up losing his pants, fully exposes himself to a minor, and ends up in prison classed as a sex offender. Also, contains a portion of a strip (one p. worth) which follows a black comic using the “n” word in the context of talking about what he believes whites think and but are afraid to say amongst blacks. .

Young: Urban book, no sex, very little violence. The only questionable scene has the main character killing an ex-boyfriend in self-defense with a nail. Lots of bad decisions and a cliff hanger ending (the sequel The Safe House comes out today). There are synopses for three books at the end, two of which are on our “not okay” list, but there’s nothing questionable in any of the synopses; Baker: No explicit sex acts. Doesn’t explicitly encourage violence. With that said, it has a lot of street violence, and women are treated really poorly in the plot. It’s a personal call. Not recommended.; Armstrong: Did not find sufficient redemptive text to counterbalance the prevalent violence, persons killed pp.203, 213, 244, life threats p.207,233, 239, verbal abuse eg. p.170-171, 173, woman beating p.170, drug prep and sale p.153-55, 184, 228, two robberies, and demand for sexual service p.166-167.

This is a medical thriller about poisoned fentanyl. It flagged because one of the reviews mentioned “sexual deviancy”. I don’t know what book that reviewer read, but it wasn’t this one. I couldn’t find anything wrong with the book. There’s no sex or violence (except in discussion), and while there’s a LOT of talking about drugs, it doesn’t tell you how to make them.
While this book has a happy ending, the first half of the book contains lots of bad stuff. Domestic abuse, gang violence, drugs, violent CO’s, etc…(Spencer not keeping)...Should be read by every offender. This book does contain references to criminal activities in prison and officers that are jerks or worse, but it’s not anything we don't already know. The good outweighs the bad completely. Highly recommend.(Hutcheson keeping) ; Details how to wrap a shank in your hand with a torn bedsheet so CO's can't pry it for your hand. (Winebrenner not keeping)
