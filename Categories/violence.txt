This is a YA book. The ”president” has opened Alcatraz 2.0, and turned it into reality television, only the murders (in the name of justice) are real and streamed 24/7. All in all it was a good read, I believe the offenders will enjoy it.

A little bit of battle gore toward the end (last two chapters), but nothing too bad. Also, nothing I thought was inflammatory.

So there’s a LOT of gore in this one. What did it for me was that the main character feels no remorse for his actions. He’s unable to empathize with his victims or even to see things from a non-selfish perspective. He’s a thug and looks at everyone he meets as if they are also only out for themselves.

Gasper - This book includes some of the author's back story about being a drug dealer. It also talks about his experiences in prison, including some of what the guards did to him. However, the good outweighs the bad and I think the offenders will get a lot out of it. There are a few recipes, his meal plan while incarcerated, how he became successful when he got out, and all of the workouts he did in prison. Spencer - The workouts look great, but the author also recounts his life story throughout the book. He talks about his past drug dealing, methods he used to increase business (especially in prison), and how the guards would beat him up, etc...young--This is an exercise book, but the author talks about how when he was in prison he would get weed from the guards and how the guards would beat on offenders for any reason whatsoever.

She describes a brutal totalitarian regime (p.39), her neighbor’s brutal beating of his wife (p.59), multiple attempted rapes of herself, and the rape of her mother as well as herself at the age of thirteen (p.4,130,131,139,140) by human traffickers. Extensive description given on the process and arrangements made for trafficking females. Book discarded due to the stark language of violence against women, esp. a minor, as well as detailed and extensive description about human trafficking.

Hutcheson: African folk lore; Chapman: The first half of the book was just fine - it was a collection of African American folklore. Apart form some historical, in context , language it didn't have anything that could be construed as inflammatory. The latter half was the kicker. This details the author's journey and appreticeship to become a voodoo, or hoodoo witchdoctor (doctress? priestess? I'm not certain of the correct term.) The issue lies in that it details - with an appendix of ingredients - the rituals in which to kill one's enemies with two variations. Furthermore in the chapter in which she participates in the ritual, her mentor receives $250 for the murder of the requested individual. Out of respect for their religious beliefs, this cannot be included in the collection as it a) encourages taking money to kill people and b) teaches people how to murder other with magic. I confered with the chaplin and he would not have allowed it in his collection either.

This did have some violence, but it was brief and not too graphic. There was one brief sex scene, but not too graphic.

the hero of the story is fighting against the authority figures of an insane asylum, introduces contraband (wine and a prostitute), incites a riot (which was a drunken party rather than a violent one, but a riot nonetheless), and creates an escape plan. The administration responses by greatly upsetting one of the inmates who then commits suicide, which the main character responses to his death by ripping the clothes off of the head nurse and beating her. The administration responses to this by giving him a lobotomy, after which the narrator of the story suffocates the main character and escapes using his escape route. Nothing is excessive in detail, but I don’t think it’s a good fit for this environment.

Too many issues. Victim of sexual assault meets up with her cousin who attacked her and he threatens to kill himself in front of her. Her family pressures her not to get the police involved. In another section police handcuff her too tight during a protest and she is denied medical treatment, even after passing out. She brings up issues with supermax prisons in another section and paints the COs who work in them as being complicit with what she equates to torture.

Historical fantasy. Pretty good story with some violence, but nothing too gruesome or graphic
One explicit scene that I would have just redacted with scotch tape, but there were also some threats made (to parents) against children that were, in my opinion, sexual horror.
The essay titled Brown vs. Ferguson contains extensive racially inflammatory language in its review of the history of the “black lives matter” episode. Additionally, this book contains a graphic strip which portrays the sad situation of a homeless alcoholic who ends up losing his pants, fully exposes himself to a minor, and ends up in prison classed as a sex offender. Also, contains a portion of a strip (one p. worth) which follows a black comic using the “n” word in the context of talking about what he believes whites think and but are afraid to say amongst blacks. .
Horror abounds in this book, "You will always have family: ..." is a short story about African witchcraft and how it victimizes one whole family with few survivors. Story recounts brutal child abuse resulting in death, superstition, and a detailed story of possession, and dispossession within a family. Story is told with graphic details including preparation of a voodoo type doll. "Loneliness is in your blood": story about an African mythic vampire who victimizes and seduces people. "Cannibal Acts" is a horrific dystopian short story which details how the biologist narrator (turned "butcher") prepares a body which is consumed by the survivors (p.292-). Returned.
Spencer - There were only a few sentences here and there about the cannibalism. Not enough to return the book. Gasper - Decided to return this one. There are not very many mentions of cannibalism but one of them was particularly disturbing. "…the children were sitting upon a log, with their faces stained with blood, devouring the half- roasted liver and heart of the father..." Too Hannibal Lector for me.

Ok, some torture, but nothing graphic, zero sex scenes, although there was a lot of erotica in a kind of "put the lotion on the skin" way.
Young: Urban book, no sex, very little violence. The only questionable scene has the main character killing an ex-boyfriend in self-defense with a nail. Lots of bad decisions and a cliff hanger ending (the sequel The Safe House comes out today). There are synopses for three books at the end, two of which are on our “not okay” list, but there’s nothing questionable in any of the synopses; Baker: No explicit sex acts. Doesn’t explicitly encourage violence. With that said, it has a lot of street violence, and women are treated really poorly in the plot. It’s a personal call. Not recommended.; Armstrong: Did not find sufficient redemptive text to counterbalance the prevalent violence, persons killed pp.203, 213, 244, life threats p.207,233, 239, verbal abuse eg. p.170-171, 173, woman beating p.170, drug prep and sale p.153-55, 184, 228, two robberies, and demand for sexual service p.166-167.

Marks: I found nothing wrong in this book.; Pasley: Scanned book, found nothing; Hutcheson: Borderline/ there's torture, but it's not so graphic that I would pull the book.
Molestation
Graphic child molestation.

because of the no-holds-barred violence
Nothing too graphic. A bad guy beats on one of the main characters (13-year- old boy), but the kid is saved pretty quickly.
This is a medical thriller about poisoned fentanyl. It flagged because one of the reviews mentioned “sexual deviancy”. I don’t know what book that reviewer read, but it wasn’t this one. I couldn’t find anything wrong with the book. There’s no sex or violence (except in discussion), and while there’s a LOT of talking about drugs, it doesn’t tell you how to make them.
Chapman - Two rapes scences before I stopped skimming through. The first on page 16 is a recollection by the main character but it's statatory as well. The second is on page 94 and has erotic detail. Then that's followed up by the main character murdering everyone in the room so we get graphic violence as well. Richtman - systematic rape of a 14-year-old, and it's graphic enough to make me stop reading (p. 16-17) Ditch - Rape and young girl, and I stopped reading pretty fast.
Richtman - one instance of prison violence instigated by a CO (p. 60-62), BUT the CO was then prosectued for it, so I kept it Hutchesom - nothing graphic Amos Decker Series, bk. 2
There were a few short torture scenes, but nothing too graphic.
Sexual Torture
Ok, worse thing was talk of the murder of a tranvestitite.
pages of graphic, gory violence, and prison rape
Review on site: inflammatory - religion
Murder and criminal activity
Hutcheson and/or Ditch: Quite a bit of street violence/gang activity. Not much sex. Pretty decent overall. Baker - Skimmed. Some violence, but ultimately it clears my test. Pasley: DWO Godert reviewed book and wrote " Sexual-Minor Violence Gang--not allowed."
Sequel to The Name of the Star. Some violence, nothing graphic
Way too much domestic violence and a viable method to escape prison
graphic, inflammatory content
While this book has a happy ending, the first half of the book contains lots of bad stuff. Domestic abuse, gang violence, drugs, violent CO’s, etc…(Spencer not keeping)...Should be read by every offender. This book does contain references to criminal activities in prison and officers that are jerks or worse, but it’s not anything we don't already know. The good outweighs the bad completely. Highly recommend.(Hutcheson keeping) ; Details how to wrap a shank in your hand with a torn bedsheet so CO's can't pry it for your hand. (Winebrenner not keeping)
First half of the book contained lots of domestic abuse, drugs, gang violence, violent CO's, etc…
Violence just might push the PG-13 mark - recommended
I didn’t find anything about this that was inflammatory. It was actually pretty dry, with lots of statistics. There were profiles throughout the book of people who had been sentenced to life, most of whom have been released. Approved by my administration.
No violence , blood or other graphic description of horror.
A character Is in a torture chamber when the book starts. No torture happens, and she escapes.
Some sex scenes and violence, but nothing too graphic.
I did not find any inapproprate scenes during review. A guy is getting arrested for the murder of 2 people. That’s it.

This has a "brutal" war. Some violence but not gory or graphic. Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne Series, bk. 2
Explicit Sex Acts with gang related violence (pgs throughout entire book; Ch. 19)
Graphic sex pg 61. Also, the book started with a domestic violence scene. I flipped and read the last few pages just to see how it ended and the last bit is those two characters getting back together, with the man promising never to lay hands on her again and the woman saying it was her own fault. I wouldn’t reject the book for that, but I *really* don’t like it.
promotes violence..knife to throat on multiple pages & gun shot to another being
On CO Censorship list ("promotes violence") for no good reason whatsoever
sex, violence
Ditch: I recommend this book. It does have some racial issues, but it is a historical fiction for the late 60s in Chicago. Some polic violence. A YA social change novel.; Winebrenner: I was on the fence about it being inflammatory, and then this line happened. "The law would not protect Father. They would always find a reason to strike down a black man..." There was also a pretty detailed scene depicting two police officers beating a young black man. And an confrontation between the (armed) Panthers and police, where they get the police to back off and then the main character thinks “Now I knew why he needed [the gun]. Why he couldn’t tuck it away and forget about it.” This is a no for me.
Encourages criminal activity
Spencer: This did have some violence, but brief and not too graphic. Couldn’t find any sex scenes in this one. Armstrong: Did not find sufficient redemptive text to counterbalance the prevalent violence, deadly threats, persons killed pp.203, 213, 244, life threats p.207,233, 239, verbal abuse eg. p.17-171, 173, woman beating p.170, drug selling p.153-55, 184, 228, 2 robberies (1 w/ detailed plan), and demand for sexual service p.166-167.
promotes violence..pg. 17 hitting with a whip..pg 33 strangulation..pg 42,51- 53, 54 decapitation..sexually explicit..pg 37, 49, 131, graphic novel
Lots of graphic sex and domestic violence between mother/daughter and husband/wife.
Lots of domestic violence and one REALLY graphic sex scene. I stopped reading after that. P. 89-90

One instance of torture (p. 274), but it's brief (2 sentences) and not very graphic or instructive.
graphic murder scenes
Stuchell: It's just funny. Added; Moore: This was an enjoyable read, but the vampire targets children and likes to drink blood from their femoral artery (near where the thigh and pelvis meet). He is caught in the act a couple of times (p.171-172 & p.335). He raped a woman (p.314-318. The rape itself is very lightly described, but the aftermath is a bit gross...The women also butcher the vampire while he's still "alive" (p. 378-383).

Walker: 2 non-graphic attempted rape scenes. Hutcheson: Reviewed by teacher Gholson, some language, but no sex, the violence was expected and not over the top. She thought it was a good book.
encourages or instructs in the commission of criminal activity - p. 104
Child molestation, rape, terrible writing. This is the sequel to The Case Manager. I would guess that the entire “Shattered Lives” series is like this, because the first two seem to revolve around survivors of child molestation and rape. And they live in some weird alternate world where no one uses contractions. Really bad writing.
bad review & potentially inflammatory
typical Western violence, very little sex (surprisingly)
sexual content, violence
too much sex, innuendo, and torture
A vampire type of novel with a twist, child abuse victims that come back as the infected.

Pasley - ok Armstrong - PP. 296-302 (chapter 33) goes into specific detail on how to launder money with Casino chips (criminal activity). Narrator notes that he does this while getting sucked in as a gang member. Tells offenders how to launder money in a casino.
Sexually explicit and drug references and violence
Winebrenner: Some fantasy violence, but nothing over the top; Smith: Not overly graphic or horrific
Graphic sex, domestic violence. Pages 60-61, 67-68, 84-86, after that I stopped looking.
A history of New Orleans, that discusses the social classes and treatment of mixed race people. Has a short discrimtion of torture techniques, but not detailed. Discusses in another short discription the role of female molatto's in the role of concubines to wealthy white men. Overall a good description of how New Orleans became to be.

Young: This is a pretty well written book. Nothing graphic, no violence. Recommended. Moore: Skimmed. Found nothing objectionable. However, there was a preview of "Stiletto Justice" at the end. The scene described women taking non-consensual graphic sexual photos of an unconscious man. I removed these pages; Smith: Nothing overly graphic

Book of short stories. One of the short stories was about dog fighting which was violent but not overly graphic. It was also from the dog's perspective which was interesting.
violence, gang warfare, he referred to custody officer as "the klansman"; two scenes of him "losing his temper"--both times he puts someone in the hospital and pays them off afterwards. He mentions all kinds of illegal and immoral activities, goes on for many pages about a "beef" with Fifty Cent (reads like gang warfare). I just don't think it's a good memoir for offenders to be reading.

Some violence - a severed head that gets tossed toward the audience and a hag that gets torn limb from limb, but that's dipicted in shadowplay. I thought it was fine.
Odd book, nothing that I would consider graphic in nature, other than second hand descriptions of apartheid. Violence and a page she speaks of wanting to masturbate after her moms death. Not sure it deserved all the good press it received.
promotes, incites, advocates, facilitates or otherwise presents a risk of lawlessness, violence, anarchy or rebellion against a government authority; contains inappropriate sexual behaviors, sexually explicit materials and pictures (I'm pretty sure this isn't the right reason. I think it's just sex.)

I didn’t purchase this book, but I was going to until I looked at the reviews on Amazon. In the reader reviews there is mention of child rape and molestation and torture. Someone also said, “There are numerous rapes of men and women (and attempted rapes).” In fact, there were seven pages of reviews that contained the word “rape” in them. I’m definitely not ordering this book.
Explicit, and there is sex, but it's not erotic. No violence. I added it.

A little too much information about how to "beat" identify theft that might be used in the opposite.
A good portion of the book was about a prison riot with descriptive/graphic violence between offenders and officers.
Very good graphic novel. Some gang violence, but the book sends a good message. Will keep. Multiple Award Winner.
