read by OSA at FRDC: I read the book looking for an optimistic view of what we can do as a people to come together for racial change. This is not what I found. Firstly the book focused on African Americans, forgetting that racism can be found in other groups in our society...None of those groups were even mentioned...It was not an optimistic view with suggestions on how to improve on an obviously broken system. It was negative with no insight on moving forward. I feel this book would insight more of a violent feeling by the reader instead of a hopeful one. At least it did for this reader. My recommendation is to pass on this particular book for the FRDC library

the book has a general air of “sexiness”, which is fine content-wise, but does not bode well for keeping the book intact, and 2) there is a scene where the main character is persuaded to have sex even though she doesn’t really want to. It’s not graphic, but I think it does fall under ” depicts or describes information detrimental to the offender’s rehabilitation”.

Marks: I found nothing wrong, I really did find it very boring; Hartel: The unimaginable horrors were acually very imaginable. Three men tried to kill her, one tried to sell her to a pevert (a child-molester) and two of the men were killed violently in front of her.. I'm sadly feeling pretty darn jaded right about now. Of course that was terrible, but after a few of our horror novels... it's rather milquetoast. But it also needed review because the full middle of the book is about an offender/staff relationship that leads to an escape. There wasn't enough how-to in there to warrant concern. It was a decent book and I think it will do well. I'm going to put it on my next order, in fact.

the hero of the story is fighting against the authority figures of an insane asylum, introduces contraband (wine and a prostitute), incites a riot (which was a drunken party rather than a violent one, but a riot nonetheless), and creates an escape plan. The administration responses by greatly upsetting one of the inmates who then commits suicide, which the main character responses to his death by ripping the clothes off of the head nurse and beating her. The administration responses to this by giving him a lobotomy, after which the narrator of the story suffocates the main character and escapes using his escape route. Nothing is excessive in detail, but I don’t think it’s a good fit for this environment.
Hutcheson: Inflamatory content, detailed police brutality, very racist languag; Clark: Consensual sex scene pgs 225-229 and explicit. Pgs. 79-82 discusses an attack by a relative and attempting suicide. Even though good story line does not meet DOC criteria.
A short story of two brothers living with a meth-addicted father. Some domestic abuse (see pp. 24, 147), but the boys eventually get out. I think it would resonate here, so I'm keeping it.

Armstrong: Did not find sufficient redemptive text to counterbalance the prevalent violence, deadly threats, persons killed pp.203, 213, 244, life threats p.207,233, 239, verbal abuse eg. p.17-171, 173, woman beating p.170, drug selling p.153-55, 184, 228, 2 robberies (1 w/ detailed plan), and demand for sexual service p.166-167.
safe; popular science, and a little simplified (doesn't go into much depth), but interesting
totally safe
Child abuse, animal abuse, and a graphic scene of the abuser getting mauled to death by the family dog. Personally, I think she deserves it, but it’s definitely too graphic to add.
contains information which can be used to instill violence or hatred among the offender population; is so radically inflammatory as to be reasonably likely to cause violence.
too long, but safe
Thriller, suspense and crime. Not discriptive or over graphic of scenes.
Some of the descriptions of crime scenes and autopisies are detailed, but it didn't cross into gory or graphic. Rizzoli and Isles Series, bk. 3

Violent argument between couple witnessed by children, graphic description of the woman beaten with a belt and her head cracked against floor twice, etc. (pp.67-71, esp.70-71); clear description of a child’s sexual abuse by a step-parent (p.148-150). Didn’t review any further.
very brief, not graphic rape scene - p. 20; domestic abuse - pp. 25-26 - I weighed them against the rest of the book and decided to keep it.
Suggest review at each institution. Note chapter 30, “Thanatos in Steel”: Reviewed & okay'd by local Admin.--term abuse not found, however referral throughout to drug abuse by & its affect upon band members. Also, blacked out sentence on p.177, end of 2nd paragaph: "Here's a tip: Before swallowing a Tuinal, pierce the capsule. It enters the bloodstream that much quicker."

NF no review - also seems to be geared to staff not offenders
A woman escapes after being beaten and sexually abused, but it's more of her telling the story of what happened, rather than a graphic detailed event. The rest is a detective novel with lots of twists figuring out who did it.

safe - typical murder mystery Large Print Edition Lincoln Rhyme Series, bk. 6
sexual references, violent racism
This book contains "Every tool you need to own"...I decided it could pose a security risk. There is one page on sharpening stones with a helpful hint on the proper way to sharpen a knife to make it nice and sharp. Every page showcases a specific tool and the best uses for that tool. I felt that it could inspire them to create something similar and use it for bad things.
Medical/Mental Health Review & in writing
Ditch - Historical fiction of slavery and escape. This does have several instances of rape and torture. It does not in my opinion cross the line into graphic and is needed for the story. MCC - Brutally frank; excellent book
Went through the whole book and did not see any security concerns.
Contains allusions to materials and basic how-to for disguises (throughout), picking locks (88, et al.), how to drug someone (164). Also, villain manages to get out of shackles, double handcuffs, and escape using a homemade handcuff key hidden by a bandaid. And, it is repeated throughout the book how all the materials can be found at any magic shop and most toy stores. I had to pull it. Lincoln Rhyme Series, bk. 5
African American fiction, not urban. Domestic abuse survivor leaves abuser, but domestic abuse not described in any detail. I found nothing
safe, and very interesting!
This volume contained a particulary gruesome scene of the main character (Rick) being shot at point blank range. Lots of blood spatter and spitting up blood, etc… Returned this one.
Security threat to our computer system
portrays or describes recipes or processes for brewing alcoholic beverages; provides technical information on the design, construction, or use of an instrument or device which could endanger institutional security or safety.
Pasley - ok Armstrong - PP. 296-302 (chapter 33) goes into specific detail on how to launder money with Casino chips (criminal activity). Narrator notes that he does this while getting sucked in as a gang member. Tells offenders how to launder money in a casino.

Information detrimental to the offender's rehabilitation
This is classified as 398.2—folklore, but it has several elements of 364.1—true crime. There are profiles of both H.H. Holmes and Elizabeth Bathory, with details of their crimes along with other serial killers who aren’t
contains detailed instructions of wrestling maneuvers, boxing maneuvers, self- defense maneuvers, or the martial arts; provides technical information on the design, construction, or use of an instrument or device which could endanger institutional security or safety
Though light-hearted and fun, this book is based on solid military tactics, contains an entire chapter on weapon selection and use, an entire chapter on how to use the terrain to your advantage in stalking or evading targets, and a small section that was starred entitled “Plan the Escape Route”.
Not gruesome at all, nothing graphic, black and white drawings and humorous stories.

Computer/Network Security, Sexually Explicit, Threats of Physical Harm - p. 12-13, 100-101
There is nothing in the least bit inappropriate. It is a wonderful story. It mentions about the abuse and restrictions, but not descriptive or evocative.
Child abuse, poor reviews
contains information which can be used to instill violence or hatred among the offender population; promotes, incites, or advocates violence
Sexually Explicit and Violent - pp. 44-45

Moore: Child abuse mentioned but not described in any detail. Added to collection; Richtman: nothing explicit/graphic

This book was interesting. Promotes non violent actions.

Mental Health Review
Safety & Security of the Institution
Several scenes of domestic abuse, but nothing graphic
Book of short stories. One of the short stories was about dog fighting which was violent but not overly graphic. It was also from the dog's perspective which was interesting.
violence, gang warfare, he referred to custody officer as "the klansman"; two scenes of him "losing his temper"--both times he puts someone in the hospital and pays them off afterwards. He mentions all kinds of illegal and immoral activities, goes on for many pages about a "beef" with Fifty Cent (reads like gang warfare). I just don't think it's a good memoir for offenders to be reading.

There are sections on his stints in prison and his prior drug use but they are shown as negative and there is nothing inflamatory. I think a lot of offenders will really be able to relate to this author.

This is a book for male victims of sexual child abuse, it does not address female victims at all. The focus on this book is recovery for male
This was one of the mental health recommendations. Focuses on learning the justifications and other factors that lead to domestic assault as well as potential for resolution. Not the most uplifting with its many personal case studies of both abuse men and abused women, but it is urging change. Added to collection.
One gruesome discription of a man who had been killed in a car wreck, basic ghost story.
2 brief sex scenes, 1 toe the line sex scene, domestic abuse, kidnapping/obsessive behavior.
This book had 2 brief sex scenes and 1 toe the line sex scene. I would have kept it, but there was also some domestic abuse (man hitting woman, banging her head on the floor) and one of the story lines was about a man obsessed with a woman. He holds her hostage and is convinced she’s going to marry him and has a room full of her pictures, etc… Pretty creepy. I’m gonna return this one.
Bad writing, but pretty much safe.
Reviewed for "descriptions of actual crime scenes". Only one crime scene was described and it was pretty vague. P. 130
gory details of torture
This was, of course, violent, but it was well done.

Safe.
Totally safe. It's a small book full of facts on the human body. Easy read.
manipulation
Scene where a character has teeth knocked out but not graphically intense or bloody. Weapons penetrate characters a few times, but not graphically detailed or bloody
surpassingly gruesome crime scenes … not for the faint of heart,
Manipulation
One short, glossed-over, sex scene. - Baker one very not-graphic sex scene; very safe - K. Richtman slightly churchy, heavy on the drama, not street at all - D. Young
Combs - Reviewed - book is hilarious - OK Richtman - safe Serge Storms Series, bk. 14
It is a collection of odd stories from history, the details are kept short and non-graphic including the prison escape.
Pretty much the entire book is about the main characters drug use and crimes committed to support the drug use.
Reviewed by educator Gholson, several sex scenes but one violent sex scene on page 348 of large print edition.
gory details of female victimization
pimping, stealing, life of crime
on page 57 of this book there is a cartoon of someone crying while looking at porn on a computer. The computer porn is very, very tiny but appears to be actual photographs of male genitalia. I used a sharpie on mine.
perfectly safe, fun urban fantasy

Has an entire chapter just on sex. Incredibly detailed - but also completely safe. It's like reading 60 minutes, but it's also pretty funny. I laughed at least three times in the one chapter. I'd recommend.
A good portion of the book was about a prison riot with descriptive/graphic violence between offenders and officers.
