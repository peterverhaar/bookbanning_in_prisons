It's a pretty good basic introduction to major religions of the world. My only caveats are: 1) It's for middle-schoolers (BIP says 12-15 yr olds, but I'd say it skews a little younger) and 2) A lot of the cool pictures are instead QR codes, which we have no access to. In general, though, this is a good, even-handed, basic introduction to major religions. (recommended-ish)

Religious fiction. Sexually Explicit; The Tempation Chronicles, bk. 1
Hutcheson: African folk lore; Chapman: The first half of the book was just fine - it was a collection of African American folklore. Apart form some historical, in context , language it didn't have anything that could be construed as inflammatory. The latter half was the kicker. This details the author's journey and appreticeship to become a voodoo, or hoodoo witchdoctor (doctress? priestess? I'm not certain of the correct term.) The issue lies in that it details - with an appendix of ingredients - the rituals in which to kill one's enemies with two variations. Furthermore in the chapter in which she participates in the ritual, her mentor receives $250 for the murder of the requested individual. Out of respect for their religious beliefs, this cannot be included in the collection as it a) encourages taking money to kill people and b) teaches people how to murder other with magic. I confered with the chaplin and he would not have allowed it in his collection either.

skimmed. Seemed okay. Some selections have a bit of a condescending attitude toward religious people, but I wouldn't call it inflammatory.

Religious Study- and bad review

A) it’s just a hop skip and jump over to actually just poisoning someone (the book include information like when belladonna has the highest concentration of alkaloids) and b) out of respect for the author’s religious beliefs I will assume curses are real and they are NOT ALLOWED IN MY LIBRARY.

This is one of the church-y urban books, but unlike most there is NO sex, and it’s SUPER religious. It was a pretty good story, well written (if a little stuffy), and with a tinge of street lit.

KB note from JCCC list: Is really in depth study of religion but not sure you will find a what is Wicca and "Wicca for Dummies" is from 2005; Ditch: This is a very frank, matter of fact look at Wicca fundamentals. I loved it for the "cat factor" in regards to alters, to the clear line that anyone requring sexual favors for teaching is a sexual predator
