Highly recommend. Interesting look especially at the fundraising work to start the National Museum of African American History.
Ok, just tells how African Americans have helped make America.
True historical account of Robert Smalls, a slave who fought for the Union, not sure why sex, or graphic was used in description, totally clean book that deals with African American history.
generally condescending way in which Smith writes about black Africans.
African American, Urban setting. Young adult. Contains one non-graphic sex scene. Added to collection.
An urban African American novel domestic drama which details no sex acts and no child mistreatment.
Ah! This pains me to return. Unfortuantely the combination of being written in the 1960's and in France leads to a depiction of Africans that could be potentially inflammatory.
Hutcheson - would recommend Ditch - No issues with this book at all. Some african american characters in this western historical fiction. (cross-posted to OK AA-Urban)
Hutcheson - Ok, Nothing graphic. Ditch - Mystery/detective with African American female detective. Pretty good series of the books read so far, no particular issues. Detective Elouise Norton Series, bk. 4
Ditch - Didn't find any issues. McCraw - Nothing bad in it and it’s pretty good. There’s lots of talk of heroin but no instructions or anything like that. Hutcheson - African American detective novel, ok, no graphic or erotic scenes Armstrong: Sex implied and violent scenes flashbacks & 1 w/ some detail. Contains urban street life, violent scene near end.
Seems like good story, nothing inflamatory. A history of a African American experience starting in slavery
Historical fiction with racial issues and dirty cops, but overall a very good read. Would recommend.
African American, not urban. I read parts and skimmed parts. Didn't find anything objectionable.
The depictions of africans and native americans could be potentially inflammaroty.
Ok, no reference to African found.
Multiple instances of derogatory language, and racist /prejudicial dialogue and content that given the current political and racial tensions, could be inflammatory.
read by OSA at FRDC: I read the book looking for an optimistic view of what we can do as a people to come together for racial change. This is not what I found. Firstly the book focused on African Americans, forgetting that racism can be found in other groups in our society...None of those groups were even mentioned...It was not an optimistic view with suggestions on how to improve on an obviously broken system. It was negative with no insight on moving forward. I feel this book would insight more of a violent feeling by the reader instead of a hopeful one. At least it did for this reader. My recommendation is to pass on this particular book for the FRDC library
Violence and racial material Bondage
Nothing extreme, gory or African, but he does love Africa. A very different Val Kilmer than I expected.
Artist Ashley Bryan shares artwork and his story from fighting in WWII in a graphic autobiography. Discusses problems/issues with segeratation and treatment of African American soldiers during WWII without being inciteful. No issues with the photographs or illustrations.
Great book, talks about life after the reconstruction in terms of racial and class bias.
This book focused a lot on the mistreatment of Africans and African Americans. I spotted text about lynching, rioting, etc…
Basic whodunnit, victim is African American . A strange book written from the victims point of view. I read it, but didn't care for it, just kind of boring. Wouldn't recommend.
Mystery/detective with African American female detective. Pretty good series of the books read so far, no particular issues. Detective Elouise Norton Series, bk. 1
African American urban book, a little violent. Takes place in a strip bar but no sex. Recommend
Poems/stories from african american traditions. Includes interesting historical notes. Good read.
A compelling read with a strong story line. No erotica or graphic sex. Non- urban. African references was to birthplace in South Africa. Contained two short sex scenes, a rape of 16 yr old,, and a briefly described suicide attempt. Positive ending. (pp.180, 253, 138-139, 201, 245
Hutcheson: African folk lore; Chapman: The first half of the book was just fine - it was a collection of African American folklore. Apart form some historical, in context , language it didn't have anything that could be construed as inflammatory. The latter half was the kicker. This details the author's journey and appreticeship to become a voodoo, or hoodoo witchdoctor (doctress? priestess? I'm not certain of the correct term.) The issue lies in that it details - with an appendix of ingredients - the rituals in which to kill one's enemies with two variations. Furthermore in the chapter in which she participates in the ritual, her mentor receives $250 for the murder of the requested individual. Out of respect for their religious beliefs, this cannot be included in the collection as it a) encourages taking money to kill people and b) teaches people how to murder other with magic. I confered with the chaplin and he would not have allowed it in his collection either.
Winebrenner: Historical fiction, main characters are terrible people, but other than that it's fine; Ditch: African American Historical fiction. No issues found. Some sex, but nothing graphic. Large Print edition.
African American romance, nothing objectionable
Spencer - This is a nice book full of pictures and a short bio on each person. These are lesser known people who made important contributions to society. Also included are lots of "In His/Her Time" lists of things going on during their lifetime. Full of information and nicely presented. (recommended) Hutcheson - 16 short biographies of African
Contained a lot of racial slurs and beating up black men in jail, etc…
African American romance, nothing objectionable
One small section on how some African tribe does "scar tattoos", but the rest of it is OK.
A great YA book that touches on the aftermath of WWI for African Americans, the suffragist movement, and the race riots of 1919. There are descriptions of violence during a riot but is not detailed.
Ditch: Teen AA--focus on African American gamers. Good story and no issues found; Spencer: The entire book is about racial discrimination. It's not violent and is geared towards young adults, but definitely could provoke heated conversations. It centers around a "blacks only" video game and questions the right of black people to discriminate against all other races and have their own "safe space". I was on the fence with this one, so decided to err on the side of caution and return it.
Good book, no graphic content, African American, but not urban.
Several consensual sex scenes, but nothing over the top, not erotica; Reviewed because there were African American protagonists. A few brief sex scenes, but nothing graphic
Horror abounds in this book, "You will always have family: ..." is a short story about African witchcraft and how it victimizes one whole family with few survivors. Story recounts brutal child abuse resulting in death, superstition, and a detailed story of possession, and dispossession within a family. Story is told with graphic details including preparation of a voodoo type doll. "Loneliness is in your blood": story about an African mythic vampire who victimizes and seduces people. "Cannibal Acts" is a horrific dystopian short story which details how the biologist narrator (turned "butcher") prepares a body which is consumed by the survivors (p.292-). Returned.
Ditch - This isn't a nice story. It is a historical fiction about two African Amricans in a Nazi Concentration Camp. While it doesn't dwell on some of the instances, it does not skip over some of the abuses. Adding it as it wasn't too graphic, just not very nice. Hutcheson - Ok, a couple of spots that showed police misconduct, but it was set in the past and was part of the era; Historical fiction with AA protagonists. Theres's a scene of torture, a riot, and cops planting evidence on people
AA/Urban Within the first chapter, detailed verbal abuse, including several racial slurs. Victim later gang raped and another character is forced into prostitution at 15. This is within the first 60 pages, I stopped reading after that. Too late to return, will dispose of
Some racial discussion, handled well. Supense/who-did-it mystery.
Combs: Reviewed OK; Armstrong: While sex occurs within the book, it is referred to in passing several times and other times non-explicitly within a single paragraph. Non-urban book (African American author), includes a “gay” character with minimal story line involvement. Issue of teenage pregnancy, abortion, suicide, as well as adultery are prominent themes which impact the aborted child’s parents, a church community, and family members. The impact on each party, including the child’s father as well as the grandfather’s response, are examined. Added book to collection.
Explores three generations of life of African American family. Nothing objectionable
Ditch: I recommend this book. It does have some racial issues, but it is a historical fiction for the late 60s in Chicago. Some polic violence. A YA social change novel.; Winebrenner: I was on the fence about it being inflammatory, and then this line happened. "The law would not protect Father. They would always find a reason to strike down a black man..." There was also a pretty detailed scene depicting two police officers beating a young black man. And an confrontation between the (armed) Panthers and police, where they get the police to back off and then the main character thinks “Now I knew why he needed [the gun]. Why he couldn’t tuck it away and forget about it.” This is a no for me.
No issues. Some racial tension issues throughout books, but none that crossed any lines. Good historical fiction overall.
African American fiction, not urban. Domestic abuse survivor leaves abuser, but domestic abuse not described in any detail. I found nothing
Short stories dealing with mostly African Americans. Found nothing wrong with it.
Baker - Skimmed for graphic content. Seems clear of anything overly graphic. Hutcheson - recommended - clean police mystery Ditch -Mystery/detective with African American female detective. Pretty good series of the books read so far, no particular issues. Detective Elouise Norton Series, bk. 3
a late teen African American centered drama book. No sex with the exception of a steamy kiss.
Richtman - I listened to this one. Although it's at an undergrad reading level (and can get quite technical at times), the author clearly explains the basics of each of his points (working his way up to the technical) and very often illustrates his points with references from pop culture. Not recommended for a camp with lower-level readers, but I believe it will be read here. Spencer - Book does contain cuss words, racial slurs and hand gestures, but only to explain origins, effect on the brain, behavior, etc… I didn't feel that it was used to rile up the reader, but rather to explain the use of. Decided to keep. Very interesting book.
Nothing objectionable; African American characters but not urban
Ditch - This is a JC. There is a rape on page 80, but it wasn't graphic. Lots of street/gang violence but it wasn't enough for me to send back. Hutcheson - To much sex and gang violence Spencer - Rape and violence Longenecker - Rape, violence, and hate between Muslims & African
